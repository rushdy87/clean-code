**Keep Your Control Structures Clean**

# Avoid Deep Nesting.

# Using Factory Functions & Polymorphism.

# Prefer Positive Checks (if isEmpty vs if isNotEmpty).

# Utilize Errors.

**Guards & Fail Fast**

**Embrace Errors & Error Handling**

# Throwing + handling errors can replace if statements and lead to more focused functions

# Simple rule: If something is an error Ã¨ Make it an error

**Factory Functions**

# A Factory Function is simply a function which is used to produce someting, for exmple to produce object, maps, arrays..
